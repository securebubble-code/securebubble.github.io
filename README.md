## Welcome

I have over 23 years of experience working in both internal support departments and technical architecture teams. In that time, I have worked up from 1st and 2nd line support on an IT helpdesk through to my current role as a Cloud Solution Architect, giving me a wide experience in many aspects of IT support, architecture and consultancy.

My main skills now are in cloud technologies - mainly AWS, GCP, Azure, smaller vCloud based providers as well as hybrid solutions such as Azure Stack. I use my expertise to offer architecture and consultancy to external clients looking to solution, design and implement in these environments, and use my knowledge and experience to meet the clientâ€™s requirements, on budget and on time.

I also have a complete background in Microsoft operating systems, networking and general 3rd and 4th line support calls, allowing me to troubleshoot or workaround issues as they arise. Since November 2021 I have been working at Secure Bubble as a freelancer to directly help clients with technical architecture and consultancy as well as hands on DevOps engineering and support.

If you're interested in my services, please drop me a note through my email, through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0107c61d9ce789e34f) or via [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonygrace/)
